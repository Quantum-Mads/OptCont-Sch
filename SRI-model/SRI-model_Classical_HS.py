SIR Model: The SIR model is a simple and widely used mathematical model to describe the spread of infectious diseases in a population. It divides the population into three compartments:

- S: Susceptible -> Number of susceptible individuals who can catch the disease.
- I: Infected -> Number of individuals who have the disease and can spread it to susceptible individuals.
- R: Recovered -> Number of individuals who have recovered from the disease and are now immune.
